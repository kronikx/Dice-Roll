## Overview

### Links

- Course URL: [URL](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)
- Live Site URL: [Github Pages](https://kronikx.github.io/Dice-Roll/)

## My Process

After following all given instructions on how to create the game. I thought it'd be much better if the game was controlled by a button, instead of having to reload the page. I implemented this button and added a dice roll audio for more lively-ness.
